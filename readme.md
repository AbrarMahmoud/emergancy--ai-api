# Emergency AI Detection System

## Overview
This project integrates three AI models for real-time emergency detection:
1. *Fire Detection* - YOLOv8 model to detect fire and smoke in images/videos.
2. *Accident Detection* - YOLOv8 model to detect traffic accidents.
3. *SOS Text Classification* - BERT-based model to detect SOS messages from text or audio.

It also includes an *alert engine* that generates structured alert messages based on the predictions.
